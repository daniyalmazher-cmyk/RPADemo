# Template: Python - Minimal

This template leverages the new [Python framework](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp), the [libraries](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp/blob/master/docs/README.md#python-libraries) from to same project as well.

The template provides you with the basic structure of a Python project: logging out of the box and controlling your tasks without fiddling with the base Python stuff. The environment contains the most used libraries, so you do not have to start thinking about those right away. 

👉 Other templates are available as well via our tooling and on our [Portal](https://robocorp.com/portal/tag/template)

## Configuration: Gmail credentials

The bot pulls input files from a Gmail inbox via IMAP. It looks for **unread**
messages whose subject contains `DLP SCAN`, downloads each message's
attachments, and marks the email as read.

Credentials live in **Robocorp Vault** under the secret name
`gmail_credentials` with two keys:

| Key        | Value                                                  |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `username` | The Gmail address (e.g. `dlp.demo.bank@gmail.com`)     |
| `password` | A Gmail **App Password** — *not* the account password. |

App Passwords: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords (2-Step Verification
must be enabled first).

### Cloud (Control Room)

Control Room → Vault → Create Secret → name `gmail_credentials` → two fields
as above. The bot picks it up automatically via `robocorp.vault`.

### Local

1. Copy `devdata/vault.example.json` → `devdata/vault.json` (gitignored).
2. Fill in your username + App Password.
3. `devdata/env.json` already sets `RC_VAULT_SECRET_FILE` so `rcc run` will
   find it.

## Running

#### VS Code
1. Get [Robocorp Code](https://robocorp.com/docs/developer-tools/visual-studio-code/extension-features) -extension for VS Code.
1. You'll get an easy-to-use side panel and powerful command-palette commands for running, debugging, code completion, docs, etc.

#### Command line

1. [Get RCC](https://github.com/robocorp/rcc?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started)
1. Use the command: `rcc run`

## Results

🚀 After running the bot, check out the `log.html` under the `output` -folder.

## Dependencies

We strongly recommend getting familiar with adding your dependencies in [conda.yaml](conda.yaml) to control your Python dependencies and the whole Python environment for your automation.

  <summary>🙋‍♂️ "Why not just pip install...?"</summary>

Think of [conda.yaml](conda.yaml) as an equivalent of the requirements.txt, but much better. 👩‍💻 With `conda.yaml`, you are not just controlling your PyPI dependencies; you control the complete Python environment, which makes things repeatable and easy.

👉 You will probably need to run your code on another machine quite soon, so by using `conda.yaml`:
- You can avoid `Works on my machine` -cases
- You do not need to manage Python installations on all the machines
- You can control exactly which version of Python your automation will run on 
  - You'll also control the pip version to avoid dep. resolution changes
- No need for venv, pyenv, ... tooling and knowledge sharing inside your team.
- Define dependencies in conda.yaml, let our tooling do the heavy lifting.
- You get all the content of [conda-forge](https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge) without any extra tooling

## What now?

🚀 Now, go get'em

Start writing Python and remember that the AI/LLM's out there are getting really good and creating Python code specifically.
